# Service Hub


This project is a Cycle Renting and Tracking System integrated with an authentication system and a Generative AI model for personalized user experiences. It allows users to rent cycles from multiple locations, track their rides, and get AI-powered suggestions based on their riding patterns and preferences.

The system provides real-time tracking, user authentication, cycle availability insights, and personalized AI recommendations, making it a modern solution for cycle rental services in urban settings.
# Features
User Authentication: Secure sign-up, login, and session management using OAuth or JWT tokens.

Cycle Renting: Users can rent a cycle from any available location and return it to any other.

Ride Tracking: Real-time GPS tracking of cycles while rented.
Generative AI Model: The AI model analyzes user data and suggests cycle routes or optimal times for renting cycles based on past behavior and user preferences.

Admin Dashboard: Admins can manage cycle inventory, track users, and view rental data.

Mobile Responsive: The website is mobile-responsive for ease of use on smartphones.

# Tech Stack
Next.js: Server-side rendering and static generation.

AWS: Scalable ML model hosting.

Gemini: Precision ML recommendations.

Vercel and Amplify: Fast, optimized deployment.

Render: Backend service hosting.

Cycle Tracking: Google Maps API

Database: DynamoDB

Cloud Services: AWS Lambda, AWS Cognito, AWS S3 (for storage)
